# Analysis of Relationship between New Housing Permits and Prices Nationwide

## Summary
This study incorporates permit and population data from the US Census Bureau, as well as real estate price data from Redfin, to attempt to establish a statistical relationship between housing construction and prices. The study covers 128 metro areas over the years 2017 through 2024 for sale prices, and 41 metro areas from 2020 through 2024 for rents. My results show a statistically significant effect of the number of building permits issued two years prior on home prices in most years studied, with a particularly strong negative effect from 2022 through 2024, as well as a positive effect in 2021. The effect of new building permits on rents was less clear, perhaps due to sample size issues, but the overall effect of new housing on rents was moderately negative. The effects were calculated using a standard multivariate linear regression model.
